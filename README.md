# DBC Project üóÇÔ∏è

## Introduction
This project involved designing clear documentation, including screenshots, based on a provided video demonstration. The video, which did not include neither sound nor explanation, served as the primary reference to showcase the usage of the **Contact Card** feature. The aim was to create a comprehensive guide for end-users (specifically agents) that clearly outlined the available actions and expected behaviors.

There was no specific indication regarding the output. However, to ensure maximum user-friendliness, I decided to create the documentation using an online output. This choice allows for easy navigation, readability, and the inclusion of visual aids to enhance understanding.

## Usage
To make the documentation more cohesive and user-friendly, I have decided to structure the guide with chapters that follow a logical order of use. While some actions described in the documentation were not explicitly shown in the video, I took the initiative to include them based on my understanding of how they can be performed. Similarly, the warnings and notes included in the documentation were not mentioned or described in the video. However, I anticipated questions that could arise from users and decided to address them. By putting myself in the shoes of the user, I aimed to provide a comprehensive and informative documentation that covers not only the demonstrated actions but also additional relevant information.

## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
Although screenshots have been deliberately omitted from this repository, the information presented accurately represents the functionality demonstrated in the video.
